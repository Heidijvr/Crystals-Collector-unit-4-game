### Project Requirements:

### Game Instructions:

  * The player will be given a random number at the start of the game. 
  * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
  * Each crystal has a value which will stay hidden until the player clicks on a crystal.  .
  * When a crystal is clicked, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score (which will indirectly
    disclose the value of the crystal). 
  * The player *wins* if their total score matches the random number assigned at the beginning of the game.
  * The player *loses* if their score goes above the random number.
  * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number; the crystals will have four new hidden values; and
  the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
* The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses (unless the page is refreshed - by which the game will be restarted).
